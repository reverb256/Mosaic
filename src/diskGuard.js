// always be written to, including the writes that free space.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A full disk does not just stop uploads. SQLite needs to write to delete a
// row, so once the volume is full an admin cannot clear the files that filled
// it: deleting the attachment is itself a write, and it fails. The instance
// wedges, and the only way out is to grow the disk from underneath it.
//
// The fix is to never hand out the last of the space in the first place. Any
// upload that would eat into the reserve is refused while there is still room
// to delete things, so the way out stays open.
