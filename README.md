Mosiac is a fork of [Haven](https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven) (the self-hosted Discord alternative) that adds
cryptographic identity (Ed25519 + Passkey), customizable MySpace-style profiles, activity feeds, pubkey-based
connections, and eventual P2P federation — all while preserving Haven's realtime chat, voice, and screenshare.

**Status:** [Phase 1 (Identity Layer)](https://github.com/reverb256/Mosiac/issues/1) in development.

# ⬡ HAVEN — Private Chat That Lives On Your Machine


**A private Discord alternative that runs on your own machine.** No cloud, no company
account, no telemetry, no paid tier. Free forever.

![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ancsemi/Haven?label=version&color=blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL--3.0-green)
![Node](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-18%20to%2026-brightgreen)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-Windows%20%7C%20Linux%20%7C%20macOS-lightgrey)

One person runs the server. Everyone else joins with a code. Messages, files and
voice never touch anybody else's infrastructure.

## Get started in about a minute

**Docker**

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v haven_data:/data ghcr.io/ancsemi/haven:latest
```

**Windows**, no Docker: download the zip, unzip it, double-click **`Start Haven.bat`**.
It installs Node.js for you if you do not have it.

**Linux / macOS**, no Docker: `chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh`

Then open `https://localhost:3000`, register with the username `admin`, make a
channel, share the code. The certificate warning on first load is expected, click
**Advanced** then **Proceed**.

## Three ways in

| | |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ **[Haven Desktop](https://github.com/ancsemi/Haven-Desktop/releases/latest)** | Windows and Linux. Per-app audio sharing (send one app’s sound, nothing else), device switching mid-call, native notifications, tray. It can also **run the server itself**. |
| 📱 **[Haven for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.havenapp.mobile&gl=US)** | On Google Play. Native, not a web wrapper. Full chat, voice and push notifications. Built by [Amnibro](https://github.com/Amnibro). |
| 🌐 **Any browser** | Nothing to install. Send a link, they are in. Works on phones. |

Apps and browser talk to the same server and see the same thing, so nobody has to
install anything to be included.

**Want to look around first?** The [community server](https://haven.moviethingy.xyz/?invite=da0b9be7)
is open, no code needed, just sign up. Volunteer-hosted, thanks MutantRabbit.

## What you get

**Coming from Discord**

- **Import your whole server history** from inside Haven. Every channel, thread,
  forum post, reaction, pin and attachment. Paste a token, pick a server, go.
- **Ferry, a two-way Discord bridge.** Messages pass both ways between a Haven
  channel and a Discord channel, under each person's real name. Friends who are not
  ready to leave Discord can still talk to the ones who did.

**Talking**

- Voice chat, peer to peer so audio never routes through the server. Per-user
  volume, mute, deafen, noise suppression, talking indicators.
- Screen sharing, several people at once in a tiled grid. Watch parties work.
- Listen together with synced playback from Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud, or a
  music player right in the voice channel.
- Threads, replies, reactions, pins, editing, mentions, polls, search, link
  previews, code blocks, spoilers.
- Direct messages, **end-to-end encrypted**. Private keys never leave the browser,
  so not even the person hosting can read them.
- Rich presence for what people are playing and listening to, via Steam, Last.fm or
  Spotify. Off until you turn it on, never written to the database.

**Making it yours**

- 26 built-in themes, a colour picker, an RGB cycle, and stackable visual effects
  like CRT, Matrix rain and snowfall.
- A plugin and theme system, so you can drop in your own without forking anything.
- Custom stickers, custom emoji, personas (send as an alternate character),
  soundboard, avatar shapes and borders.
- Server branding, sidebar layout options, font size and density controls.
- 8 languages out of the box, community translated.

**Running it**

- **One-click updates from inside the app.** Haven takes a pre-update backup and
  restarts itself.
- **Built-in backups**, scheduled or on demand, with restore.
- **Single sign-on** via OpenID Connect, so Authentik, Keycloak, Authelia and Auth0
  all work as your login.
- **Bots and webhooks** with a REST API. Send messages, play soundboard sounds,
  register slash commands, join voice, receive signed callbacks.
- Roles with per-channel permissions. Kick, timed mute, ban, IP bans, slow mode,
  automod link filtering, an audit log, and a moderation API.
- Guest accounts, invite links, per-channel join codes with automatic rotation.
- Push notifications, including UnifiedPush if you would rather leave Google out.
- Built-in Cloudflare and LocalTunnel support, so friends can reach you without
  port forwarding.
- Bcrypt passwords, JWT auth, HTTPS, MFA, rate-limited logins, and a disk reserve
  so a full drive never wedges the server.
